###


1) Read in all 3 cohorts (individually) DPCP1, DPCP2, DPCP3 
2) Separate into PCP and SALINE animals (possible to just look at saline)
3) Separate into lick day data (all and last) and distraction day data (main and hab)

4) Work out basic parameters for groups and days
    (a) Number of bursts, clusters, runs 
    (b) Palatability for saccharin score based on these 
    (c) Mean. median number and length of bursts/etc

5) Predictive correlations or linear regression 
6) Machine learning, support vector machines (with scores from lick day to predict distractedness)
7) Scores from distraction day to predict group membership (are they PCP or SAL)

8) Subtle differences in PCP, timings and intervals of licks on licks day 

9) Different classifications of distracted or not? 

10) Variables for statistical comparison

11) If no PCP effect, clear analysis of distraction behaviour
    (a) What it does to bursts and licks 
    (b) How it affects consumption in general (is this still stable but structurally different)
 
    
# All data on R drive, move to hard drive for access and add the med files to git 
# in 3 folders of DPCP1, DPCP2, DPCP3 

# No metafile dor DPCP3!! 

# Which is male and female? Checking over "sheets"
