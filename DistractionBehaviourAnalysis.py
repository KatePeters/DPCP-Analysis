#FEMALES
#
#
#! With the lickcalc output, add it to a master list of lists or dictionary/list 
#of dictionaries so that it can be indexed by file / rat / day 
#
#A male dictionary and a female discitonary / list of lists is probably best 
#
#
##(3)    
#for distraction days for all rats (all after the last lick, for cols with 2):
#    take that lick variable and run DistractioCalc2 (on just distraction days, and modelled?)
#    take d produced from DistractionCalc2 and run distractedOrNot on all
#    store in a list called --> distracted or not 
#
#! Sanity check that numbers are what expected (with small differences for med issue)
##(4) Sort by day, treatment and sex
## Analyse licking only 
## Metafile extractor will produce the lists of which rats are which (twice m and f)
#
#take data from last licking day only (use meta extractor to index just this day)
#
#   
#for all lists of licks :
#    do lickcalc
#    and if sal (from variable lists in metaextractor) store in one place (define earlier)
#    and if pcp store here
#    
#    #this will produce all the burst info for each rat on each day 
#    # store these values and then later, find the means / medians like THPH1 and 2
#    
#    # just last licking day, are there differences between pcp and saline here?
#    # no. bursts, runs, etc. set boundaries for cut offs 
#    
#DISTRACTION
#
##(5) Compare real and modelled distractors
#
#for last lick day do the distracted or not / access from earlier variables stored :
#    compare this to the lick day 
#    work out percentage distracted 
#    work our PDPs (all)
#    work out PDPs (distracted) and pdps (not distracted)
#    
#other metrics of distraction ?? 
#
#compare ALL rats distraction and habituation 
#
#compare all rats habituation and SAL and AMPH 
#
#for amphetamine, PDPs, percentage etc. 
#  
#
#GROUP DATA (ways to subset)
#
#MALES 
#PCP lick day mean PDP, mean percentage distracted, mean/median bursts
#PCP distraction day mean PDP, mean percentage distracted, mean/median bursts
#PCP habituation day mean PDP, mean percentage distracted, mean/median bursts
#PCP salineIP day mean PDP, mean percentage distracted, mean/median bursts
#PCP amphetamineIP day mean PDP, mean percentage distracted, mean/median bursts
#
#SAL lick day mean PDP, mean percentage distracted, mean/median bursts
#SAL distraction day mean PDP, mean percentage distracted, mean/median bursts
#SAL habituation day mean PDP, mean percentage distracted, mean/median bursts
#SAL salineIP day mean PDP, mean percentage distracted, mean/median bursts
#SAL amphetamineIP day mean PDP, mean percentage distracted, mean/median bursts
#
#FEMALES 
#PCP lick day mean PDP, mean percentage distracted, mean/median bursts
#PCP distraction day mean PDP, mean percentage distracted, mean/median bursts
#PCP habituation day mean PDP, mean percentage distracted, mean/median bursts
#PCP salineIP day mean PDP, mean percentage distracted, mean/median bursts

#
#
#Statistics (probably not in Python, probably use SPSS or R)
#
#ANOVA - effects of day, effects of PCP (in males and in females)
#ANOVA - effects of sex on distraction OR 3 way ANOVA (although 2 cohorts far appart)
#
#
## NOR
#
## Add in NOR scores for each rat too, the DI and then calculate group info 
#
## (1) Is there a NOR deficit when all male data are combined, is there a deficit in females
#
## (2) Does the individual NOR score correlate with any distraction measure??
#
## Correlations 
#
## Individual variations in burst number, cluster number and mean INTERBURST INTERVAL
#    # compared (correlation or regression) to PDP and distracted percentage
